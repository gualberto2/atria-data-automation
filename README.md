# Atria - Advisor Data Automation Extension
in collaboration with `@akibiaons`

*This app is no longer supported.*
---

Atria is a wealth management company who saught improvements in their data entry process.
Many employees would by hand type data in from an excel sheet, onto a slow loading website with multiple pages and forms.

This app was a direct solution to the previous slow input issue, which would take advisors up to a *month*, to complete a list
of about 500 new clients. Atria since then has been bought out and no longer requires this apps usage.

Key highlights:
1. No outside processees - We kept everything within the browser. No need to install new software, keep up with updates or anything. Your browser would instantly be given new updates when needed
2. Error log - Errors would be recorded, any cells missing data that could not be completed could be accessed post auto. Prevented possible estimated AFK sessions and coming back to 3 done due to a single cell missing something like a name.
3. Post-Automation log - On top of errors being recorded, we ensured that the client would be given warnings, tips, and messages that gave them feedback on the automation process.
4. Easy maintainability - In the case the site were to update, the code was easily accessible and editable. Making it easy to get back up and running.
